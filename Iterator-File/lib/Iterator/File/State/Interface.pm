=head1 NAME

Iterator::File::State::Interface -- Interface for Iterator::File state classes

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All data sources should subclass Iterator::File::State::Interface, overriding
methods as appropriate.

Iterator::File::State::Interface inherits from Iterator::File::Utility.

=over 4

=item B<new(%config)>

Each subclass can take a %config hash.  Keys/meaning will be specific to
each subclass.

=cut

=item B<initialize()>

Initilizes any requirements for class.  (E.g., prepping temp files.)  The
iterator is not available until after initialize is invoked.

=item B<advance_marker()>

Increments the marker by one.

=cut

=item B<marker()>

Return the current value of the marker.

=cut

=item B<set_marker( $num )>

Sets the value of the marker to $num.  Note this update is independent
of any changes to the source file.

=cut

=item B<finish()>

Perform any required clean up once we're done.
