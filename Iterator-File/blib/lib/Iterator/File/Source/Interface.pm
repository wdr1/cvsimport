=head1 NAME

Iterator::File::Source::Interface -- Interface for Iterator::File data sources

=head1 DESCRIPTION

All data sources should subclass Iterator::File::Source::Interface & implement the methods defined here.

Iterator::File::Source::Interface inherits from Iterator::File::Utility.

=over 4

=item B<new(%config)>

Construct the object.  Argument validation.  Default assignment.

=cut

=item B<initialize()>

Any heavy lifting should occur here.  E.g., opening a file or shared memory segment.

=cut

=item B<next()>

Advance the iterator & return the new value.

=cut

=item B<value()>

Return the current value, without advancing.

=cut

=item B<advance_to( $location )>

Advance the iterator to $location.  If $location is B<behind> the current location, behavior
is undefined.  (I.e., don't do that.)

=cut

=item B<finish()>

Invoked when all is complete so that cleanup may occur.
