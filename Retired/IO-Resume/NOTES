* Explict user overrides default
  - user stating a start overrides a recovery
* Output
  - appended when recovering, user-interaction results in a new file?

==================== Use Cases ====================

"Bad" line
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Job stops with error on row X
- User run ad-hoc with just X
- User either
  - refines function/data so that X is now okay
    - final output should have everything before & after run
  - indicates to skip X
    - final output should have everything before & after run, minus X

Problems w/ Batch Jobs
- Terminate in the middle
  * ideally continue processing the rest and let us come back to the bad ones, or at the very least restart there
- status, eta of completion
- Re-try flaky services
- stop & restart
- retry just a particular case
